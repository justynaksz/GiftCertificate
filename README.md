## 4. TODO List

***

- [x] Develop web service for Gift Certificates system with the following entities (many-to-many) 
  - [x] CreateDate, LastUpdateDate - format ISO 8601 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Example: 2018-08-29T06:12:15.156. More discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914404/how-to-get-current-moment-in-iso-8601-format-with-date-hour-and-minute
  - [x] Duration - in days (expiration period)
- [ ] The system should expose REST APIs to perform the following operations:
  - [ ] CRUD operations for GiftCertificate. If new tags are passed during creation/modification â€“ they should be created in the DB. For update operation - update only fields, that pass in request, others should not be updated. Batch insert is out of scope.
  - [x] CRD operations for Tag.
  - [ ] Get certificates with tags (all params are optional and can be used in conjunction):
    - [x] by tag name (ONE tag)
    - [x] search by part of name/description (can be implemented, using DB function call)
    - [ ] sort by date or by name ASC/DESC (extra task: implement ability to apply both sort type at the same time).
